# Kaggle Practice Notebooks

This repository contains my practice notebooks where I learn, experiment, and apply different data science and machine learning techniques using various Kaggle datasets.

## üìÇ Notebooks Included

- **Digit Recognizer (MLP97)**  
  A neural network approach to the classic MNIST digit recognizer dataset.

- **House Prices Prediction**  
  Predicting house prices using regression models and feature engineering.

- **Neural Network for Heart Disease Detection**  
  A neural network to classify heart disease presence using health data.

- **Stroke Risk Prediction (XGBoost + SMOTE + SHAP)**  
  Predicting stroke risk with XGBoost, using SMOTE for class imbalance and SHAP for explainability.
  
- **Titanic Survival Prediction (Baseline ML)**
  A straightforward machine learning approach to predict passenger survival on the Titanic dataset.

- **Student Performance in Exam**  
  Analyzing and predicting student exam scores using different features.

- **Used Vehicle Price Prediction (Full EDA & ML)**  
  End-to-end project: Exploratory Data Analysis and Machine Learning to predict used vehicle prices.
- **Face Mask Detection (CNN)**
  Detecting whether a person is wearing a mask or not using Convolutional Neural Networks on image data.
